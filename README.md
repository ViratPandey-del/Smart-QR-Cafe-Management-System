# ☕ Smart QR Cafe Management System

A modern **QR Code Based Cafe Management System** built using the **MERN Stack**. Customers can scan a QR code placed on their table to access the digital menu, browse food items, add them to the cart, and place orders without waiting for a waiter.

The system also provides an **Admin Dashboard** to manage menu items, monitor orders, and maintain the cafe efficiently.
